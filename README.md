# Sudoku-Solver

Sudoku.java initializes a sample 9x9 sudoku puzzle, solves it, and prints the solved puzzle.


## Description

Solves a Sudoku puzzle using recursive backtracking. just for fun / experimenting

### Sudoku Rules
1. Objective: Fill in the whole 9x9 map with 9 unique sets of numbers 1-9
2. Each row must have only one set of each number 1-9
3. Each column must have only one set of each number 1-9
4. Each 3x3 block must have only one set of each number 1-9

### Getting Started
1. install Sudoku.java
2. have a computer beat you at your favorite game

## Acknowledgements
Algorithm based off of https://gist.github.com/ssaurel 's implementation. 

Inspired by my (not so) secret obsession - sudoku

### Takeaways from this experience
1. Reinforced my understanding of recursive backtracking
2. Exposure to (the never-ending) Java API  
3. Created many new ideas for expansion (solve with dynamic programming/memoization?, sudoku-solver in python or scala, expand to read files of puzzle, create an Android Sudoku app, etc.)
